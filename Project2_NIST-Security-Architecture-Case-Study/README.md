# Description
Initial security architecture case study (NIST framework)

## Overview
This project presents a security architecture and risk-based design for a fictional Department of Defense (DoD)-aligned organization. The objective was to design a secure, compliant environment using the NIST framework while balancing operational needs, risk tolerance, and regulatory constraints.

This case study demonstrates how security controls, governance, and architectural decisions are mapped to real-world organizational requirements.

## Problem Statement
The organization required a comprehensive security design to protect sensitive data, ensure compliance with federal security standards, and reduce risk across users, systems, and network domains.

Key challenges included:
- Protecting sensitive and regulated information from advanced threats
- Implementing access controls without disrupting mission operations
- Aligning technical security controls with NIST guidance
- Balancing usability, scalability, and security effectiveness

## Organizational Context & Assumptions
- Organization type: DoD-aligned federal contractor (fictional)
- Regulatory environment: NIST-based federal security requirements
- Threat landscape: Advanced persistent threats (APT), insider risk, unauthorized access
- Constraints:
  - Budget limitations
  - Need for scalable security controls
  - Operational continuity requirements

## Frameworks & Standards Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-series guidance
- Defense-in-depth security principles
- Least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC)

### User Domain
- Centralized identity and access management (IAM)
- Role-based access control aligned with job functions
- Multi-factor authentication for privileged and remote access
- Ongoing security awareness and training to reduce human risk

### Network & Perimeter Security
- Network segmentation to limit lateral movement
- Firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems
- Secure LAN-to-WAN architecture
- Centralized logging and monitoring for visibility

## Risk Management Approach
Risks were identified and mitigated using a risk-based methodology aligned with NIST guidance. Controls were selected based on:

- Threat likelihood
- Potential business and mission impact
- Organizational risk tolerance

Security decisions prioritized reducing high-impact risks while maintaining system availability and operational effectiveness.

## Outcomes & Recommendations
The proposed security architecture:
- Aligns with NIST security principles and federal expectations
- Reduces attack surface through layered controls
- Improves visibility, monitoring, and incident response readiness
- Establishes a scalable foundation for future security enhancements

## Reflection & Real-World Considerations
If implemented in a real-world environment, additional considerations would include:

- Continuous monitoring and control reassessment
- Integration with legacy systems
- Ongoing compliance validation and audits

This project strengthened my ability to think systemically about security architecture, governance, and risk trade-offs in regulated environments.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Security architecture design
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- NIST framework application
- Technical writing and documentation
- Systems-level security thinking
